<Latest project> 
Calender Calculator official app

This app gives many options to user. Right now it has 5 options, that is:
1. Find the day at any date.
2. Find difference between two dates in hours, days, months and years and it also tells the days at those two dates.
3. 5-6 Facts about any date.
4. All the dates falling on a particular day in a given interval. For example all the Sundays in 1 year period or 5 year period.
5. History of user inputs.
I am already working on a new patch and hopefully with this new patch many new features will be added ;)
